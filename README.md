# jQuery-firstApp
This is the first jQuery app, which shows how jQuery can be used to play with DOM.

Let's see what exactly is DOM and what happens when jQuery/JavaScript meets the DOM.

1) The developer codes a HTML file with all structures, styles and behaviors.
2) The browser reads the HTML and renders a document based upon the Document Object Model (DOM).
3) The original HTML never changes, it's the document representation which changes as per the scripting functionality written in the code.
4) Say let's a visitor of the web page clicks a button, the JavaScript interpreter of the browser hears for the click event and changes the document representation of the original HTML page accordingly, and the visitor sees the color of the background changed to red or something else. In simple terms, it can be stated that the JavaScript interpreter changes the DOM representation of the page. The original HTML/CSS files are intact.

jQuery helps us to play with the DOM in a failry easy way as compared to JavaScript, at the end, JavaScript ultimately is being generated, but we don't need to do the heavy lifting when we are using jQuery.
